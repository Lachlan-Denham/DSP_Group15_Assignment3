# Structure
streamlit_app.py contains all front end visualisation code.  
The python files in the src folder contain the pandas functions used.  
The test subfolder contains all the tests for the files found in the src folder.
main.py is used to run the app and was created to bypass issues with relative imports.  


# Instructions
Run on a Python 3.8.2 Environment with the imports seen in the requirements.txt  
requirements.txt imports could likely be streamlined, the file was created by funnelling imports from Lachlan's 3.8.2 virtual environment.  
Alternatively run on docker using the steps provided in the report.
